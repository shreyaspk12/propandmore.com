**🔥 The Upside Down – UGC + Web Developer Portfolio**

A dark, neon-inspired portfolio website built with a cinematic horror aesthetic inspired by Stranger Things.

This project showcases my dual identity as:

🎥 UGC Video Creator

💻 Web Developer

The goal was to combine storytelling, branding, and technical execution into one immersive experience.

🧠 Concept

Instead of building a typical clean portfolio, this project uses:

Dark horror UI

Neon red glow effects

Flicker animation

Cinematic hero section

Immersive card layout

The idea:

Enter my world. Discover my work.
